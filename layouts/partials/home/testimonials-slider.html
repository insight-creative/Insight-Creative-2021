                        <p>"Bank of Luxemburg has been extremely pleased with the results of the rebranding initiative ... I believe that Insight Creative was instrumental in the success of this project. They guided our rebranding team and made sure that it was delivered on time, within budget and answered any of our questions along the way. They were able to come up with a marketing plan that captured the essence of our bank and was very well received by our community and customers. Above all, they made the overall process very easy for me, the bank president, which allowed me to concentrate on other aspects of the bank’s strategic plan.”</p>

                        <p>"Our sales have exploded, and it is all because of Insight Creative. When we started working with Insight, we asked how we would know if our marketing was successful. You responded that it wouldn’t be as simple as a client comment or a web measurement, but over time we would slowly see our business increase. You also warned us that it wouldn’t happen overnight. You said it would take time and we needed to be patient. Four years later, we are so busy we need to hire three office people and an entire crew. The best part is the caliber of new business we have received is outstanding. We are extremely happy with Insight!”</p>
