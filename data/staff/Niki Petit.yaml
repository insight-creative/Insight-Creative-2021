  heading: How she got here
  body: >-
    After obtaining her bachelor’s degree in economics and political science from UW-Madison, Niki began working for a local radio station where she helped launch 95.9 KISS FM. Though she enjoyed her work and remained in radio for nine years, Niki began to dream of a position where she could use her passion and marketing expertise to help businesses beyond radio marketing.


    She had worked with just about every agency in town during her time in radio and was impressed with the leadership and results that Insight provided. She came on board in 2005 and has been helping to grow Insight and our clients’ businesses ever since.
