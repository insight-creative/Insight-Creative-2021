    With a passion for numbers, Cindy enjoys analyzing financials to help companies stay profitable and strategic. She began her career as an accounting manager at a distribution company, processing accounts payable and receivable for thirteen companies under their management.  


    She later stepped away to focus on raising her three children and helping run the family farm. In 2013, she became the part-time clerk for the Town of Glenmore—an elected position she held for 12 years—where she handled the financials, accounting and taxes. 


    She holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. Norbert College.
