  body: >-
    Nicole was interested in media from an early age and obtained her bachelor’s degree in communication media and theater from St. Norbert College. Soon after graduation, she took an account executive position at a radio broadcasting station, where she grew her passion and experience for marketing and account management.


    She spent nearly 25 years in radio marketing before bringing her talent and expertise to the Insight team. She had worked with Insight as a vendor in her previous role and was excited by the quality of work we produce, as well as the opportunity to gain experience within a new facet of marketing.
