  heading: How he got here
  body: >-
    Jay has loved design since he was little, building structures out of Legos and creating home designs for fun. Instead of pursuing architecture, like he once thought he would, he opted to obtain his bachelor’s degree in graphic design from UW-Milwaukee so that he could work on a wider variety of visual design projects.


    Soon after starting out as a professional graphic designer, Jay began expanding his photography and video production skills. He obtained a drone pilot license and worked at various agencies before bringing his design skills, technical savvy and creative management experience to Insight.

  body: Jay loves all things music—especially hard rock. When he’s not at a live concert or music festival or watching the latest musician biopic, you can usually find him camping, playing sports or spending time at the beach with his family.
marketing_tip:
  body: <p>Even though you might <em>think</em> you’ve thought of the best idea, keep pushing for more. You can’t stop at just one, or even two or three. You’ll be surprised by the things that will emerge, and even if you land back on your first idea, you’ll have better validation that it’s the best.</p>
