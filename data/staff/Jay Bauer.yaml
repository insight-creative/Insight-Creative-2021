  heading: How he got here
  body: >-
    Jay has loved design since he was little, whether it was recreating sports logos, getting creative with Legos or drawing home designs for fun. Though he once considered pursuing architecture, he chose to earn a degree in graphic design with a minor in computer science from UW-Milwaukee, allowing him to work on a broader range of visual design and marketing projects.


    Early in his career as a graphic designer in Milwaukee, Jay began expanding his skills in photography and video production. He gained expertise in editing with Adobe Premiere, earned a drone pilot's license, incorporated AI tools and enhanced his technical skills and creative management abilities while working at Insight.

  body: Jay loves his family, life, sports and all things music—especially hard rock. When he's not playing basketball with his son, golfing with his daughter or at a rock concert, you'll usually find him camping, chilling with his cats or hanging out at the beach with others.
marketing_tip:
  body: <p>Even though you might <em>think</em> you’ve thought of the best idea, keep pushing for more. You can’t stop at just one, or even two or three. You’ll be surprised by the things that will emerge, and even if you land back on your first idea, you’ll have better validation that it’s the best.</p>
