    Molly dreamed of being on the big screen as a child, which led to a career in broadcast TV and ultimately brought her to Insight in 2008.


    Molly joined the Insight team as a copywriter and video producer for multiple years before transitioning to media in 2013. She worked her way up from media coordinator to buyer to director.
