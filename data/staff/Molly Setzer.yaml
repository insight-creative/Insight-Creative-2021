  heading: How she got here
  body: >-
    Molly dreamed of being on the big screen as a child, which later lead her to obtain her bachelor’s degree in communication processes with an emphasis in electronic media from UW-Green Bay. After graduation, she pursued a position at a local news station with the intention of working up to a reporter role. Instead, her interest was sparked by the behind-the-scenes world she discovered while working in the promotions department.


    From there, Molly joined the Insight team as a copywriter and video producer for multiple years before transitioning to media in 2013. With her diverse background in media marketing, Molly quickly took on her current media director role.

  body: Molly is the health and wellness fanatic here at Insight. In fact, Molly is up and off to complete her morning run before most of us have gotten out of bed for the day. You may find her taking a quick walk around the office to get her steps in and she always has great health tidbits to share with the team.

  body: Optimize your website to be mobile-friendly or you are essentially irrelevant. Over half of online searches and web visits are now made from mobile devices.
