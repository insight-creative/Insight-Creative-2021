  body: >-
    Sam’s love of design was fostered during her freshman year at Carroll University, where she designed flyers and other visual materials for her residence hall. From there, she transferred to UW-Green Bay where she earned her bachelor’s degree in design arts with a minor in art. She spent two years post-graduation honing her design skills and applying them to client projects at a local agency before joining the Insight team in 2018.
