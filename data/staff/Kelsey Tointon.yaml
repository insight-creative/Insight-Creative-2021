    Kelsey began her career as a marketing assistant at Parallel 44 Vineyard & Winery, where she built digital strategies, designed graphics and helped plan events. From there, she developed her skills through administrative and marketing roles in the finance, healthcare and nonprofit fields, including at the Door County YMCA and Community Health Systems in Tennessee. Her passion for supporting local businesses led her to Insight, where she’s excited to help businesses succeed through effective marketing.

    Kelsey has a sourdough starter named Delilah. She feeds it flour and water until it gets bubbly—then, it’s ready to bake. Part of the starter becomes a loaf of bread. The whole process takes about two days, which Kelsey likens to a science experiment in the kitchen. 


    The results? Warm, homemade bread, including jalapeño cheddar, Italian herb and cheese and cinnamon roll variations. She’s even made loaves with flower designs, stems and leaves.
