  body: >-
    Theresa obtained her bachelor’s degree in graphic design from UW-Green Bay, but she knew early on that she didn’t want a career that focused solely on design. She minored in communications and found her passion for social media management in her first job out of college, where she honed her marketing skills for two years before joining the Insight team.
