    Melissa’s interest in creative writing began at age nine when she wrote her first book. Now, her professional writing experience spans two decades. 


    She began her career in rural newspapers and moved to Green Bay after accepting a job at the Press-Gazette. For the next 10 years, her love of writing flourished through business storytelling and as executive editor of several lifestyle magazines, including _YOU Magazine_. 


    In 2016, Melissa published her first novel, _Arrows_, with Penguin Random House. She has worked in writing and communications ever since, including three years at a marketing agency. She holds a master’s degree in writing from Vermont College of Fine Arts.
