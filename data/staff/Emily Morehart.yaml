  body: >-
    Emily was introduced to the advertising world at UW-Oshkosh, where she obtained her bachelor’s degree in journalism with an advertising/public relations emphasis. She was instantly hooked and began her professional advertising career in 2006, working her way up through various roles at a cable marketing company where she eventually became the managing editor.


    She then brought her editorial experience to grow Insight’s content department, where she worked in all capacities within the department before taking on her current management role.

  body: Working with an exciting variety of projects and people. Each day is different and I love that I’m able to flex my creativity in new ways with each job that comes across my desk!

  body: Emily is one of the biggest foodies here at Insight—though she’s in good company. She loves watching Top Chef, preparing meals for her family, trying new food and restaurants and enjoying quality time with loved ones around the dinner table.
marketing_tip:
  body: Don’t underestimate the value of defining and refining your brand identity. If you don’t have a strong idea of who you are, why you exist or your future plans, all of your communications will suffer.
