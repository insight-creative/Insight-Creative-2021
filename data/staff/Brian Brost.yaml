  body: >-
    Brian has always had a passion for working with a diverse range of people to meet their needs, which lead him to obtain his bachelor’s degree in hospitality and tourism management from UW-Stout. Though he worked in the hospitality industry in Chicago directly out of college, he quickly transitioned to a company closer to the Green Bay area, where he worked in various positions until ultimately becoming a large-group account executive. 


    Brian stayed within this position for 13 years before transitioning to media sales and account management. After seven years at two local television stations, Brian sought an account executive position where he could provide his clients with a full range of marketing services. This brought him to Insight, where he utilizes his invaluable sales, marketing and customer relations skills to help his clients and their businesses thrive.

  body: Brian is a true family man and loves taking every opportunity to spend quality time with them, especially at their campsite in Eagle River. Always along for the ride, his dogs Sophie and Crosby frequently tag along with Brian to the Insight office. The two love to put in a hard day’s work receiving copious amounts of pets and treats before returning home to cuddle up with (or mildly annoy) Lewy, the family cat.
