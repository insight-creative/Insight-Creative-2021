  heading: How he got here
  body: >-
    Justin’s initial interest in development stemmed from his life-long love of video games. He obtained his associate's degree in software development, where he realized he was much more interested in the front-end side of things through taking HTML and web development courses. He continued to hone his knowledge and began his own freelance web development business, which he ran for 2 years. 


    Soon, Justin decided to give agency life a try and started following various agencies in the area. Insight stood out to him because of the well-thought-out campaigns they were producing, so he applied as soon as a development position opened. He came on board in 2018 and has been creating stunning, functional websites for our clients—including redesigning the Insight website—ever since.
