  heading: Fighting crime, one news segment at a time
  copy: "<p>When local law enforcement approached Verve, a Credit Union to join their battle against online scammers, they were all in. But to make a real impact, Verve knew a community collaboration would be essential. As a result, the Fraud Squad was born and Insight Creative joined as public relations and media specialists. Leveraging local connections across Northeast Wisconsin, Insight Creative hoisted Verveâ€™s Fraud Squad further into the spotlight with extensive TV, Radio, print and online coverage.</p>"
