  heading: A bold brand remodel
  copy: '<p>Fox Structures, a local full-service builder specializing in agricultural and commercial construction, has been in business since 1982. The well-established builder approached Insight for a brand refresh to better represent the bold, professional vibe of their expert team and quality work. First, the new brand rolled out internally with apparel, letterhead, business cards and various office materials. Next, they kicked off their public brand reveal at the largest industry show of the year with a fully custom tradeshow booth, also accompanied by fresh job site signs, an updated website, public relations/social media announcements and highly visible outdoor creative. </p>

testimonial: 
  copy: "Our sales have exploded, and it is all because of Insight Creative. When we started working with Insight, we asked how we would know if our marketing was successful. You responded that it wouldn’t be as simple as a client comment or a web measurement, but over time we would slowly see our business increase. You also warned us that it wouldn’t happen overnight. You said it would take time and we needed to be patient. Four years later, we are so busy we need to hire three office people and an entire crew. The best part is the caliber of new business we have received is outstanding. We are extremely happy with Insight!"
