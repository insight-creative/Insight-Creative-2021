  copy: "Bank of Luxemburg has been extremely pleased with the results of the rebranding initiative ... I believe that Insight Creative was instrumental in the success of this project. They guided our rebranding team and made sure that it was delivered on time, within budget and answered any of our questions along the way. They were able to come up with a marketing plan that captured the essence of our bank and was very well received by our community and customers. Above all, they made the overall process very easy for me, the bank president, which allowed me to concentrate on other aspects of the bank’s strategic plan."

  ## Putting “community” in community banking

  Embedded in the Luxemburg community since 1903, Bank of Luxemburg knew their nearly 70-year-old brand needed a drastic update in order to grow. They also knew maintaining their community roots and relationship-based approach would be paramount to success. While considering both objectives, the Insight team reimagined Bank of Luxemburg’s brand beginning with a vibrant orange logo and tagline “Your Life. Your Community. Your Bank.” Additional brand attributes such as voice, colors, typography and even illustrated fictional spokespeople were carefully crafted to support the overall look and feel.

  After establishing a solid brand, a comprehensive rollout plan was developed and quickly put into action. The new brand came to life externally on TV, radio (with a custom jingle), billboards, print ads and outdoor signage. Internally, the brand was introduced on employee apparel, lobby signage, office materials and even custom wallpaper! To ensure a smooth transition for Bank of Luxemburg’s many long-term customers, Insight led a multi-touchpoint campaign (postcards, letters and social media posts) that not only communicated the change but also generated excitement for the future of the bank and its communities.
