  ## From Concept to Booked-Out Clinic

  Ellie Reineck from [Surgical Associates](https://sawisconsin.com/) approached us with an innovative idea. Their doctors wanted to start offering vasectomies on Fridays, but instead of doing the procedure at their main clinic, they planned to use the [Elevé](https://www.elevemedspa.com/) space. The vibe at Elevé is calming—soothing music, peaceful rooms and a spa-like feel. The goal was to make the experience feel more personal for men, even a little luxurious, like a concierge-style clinic day. It was a brand-new concept, and our team was excited to bring it to life. 

  We knew this campaign needed to break the mold. Vasectomies make a lot of guys nervous, so we wanted everything from the messaging to the design to be light and a little funny. That’s where the headline “Snip, Snip, Hooray” came in. We launched in March to line up with March Madness, giving patients the perfect excuse to relax at home and watch basketball post-procedure. We created fun, upbeat ads with jazzy music and visuals like balloons with scissors hanging from them. We created posters for exam rooms, booked media buys and produced a short vocal stinger for digital ads. We even designed thank-you cards and gift baskets with Elevé gift certificates inside—something nice for the patient’s partner and a smart way to drive return traffic to Elevé. A “what to expect” patient packet tied it all together with useful info about the procedure, recovery and day-of prep. Pieces of the campaign were also added to the website. 

  The media strategy was key to reaching our intended audience. We ran digital ads on ESPN.com and the ESPN app—perfect placement for sports-minded guys already tuned into March Madness. Streaming radio ads ran across major platforms, keeping the campaign top of mind during daily commutes or workouts. A targeted digital campaign rounded it all out, helping us reach the right people at the right moment.  

  The result? A big win. We were asked to turn everything around in just four weeks and start getting patients in the door right away—and we did. The ESPN strategy delivered 250K impressions with 94 clicks. Streaming radio and podcasts reached 43,433 music listeners and 30,477 podcast listeners. The schedule on Spotify received 76,502 impressions with 6,203 reach and 23 clicks. Best of all, Surgical Associates started booking out fast, proving that the campaign worked and that people responded to the fresh, stress-free take.
