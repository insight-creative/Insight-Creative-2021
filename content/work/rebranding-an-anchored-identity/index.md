intro: '<p>A business that set sail in 1940, the Washington Island Ferry has been a thriving and vital conduit to island life and tourism for decades. After years of promoting the island and its sole source of transportation under a well-established brand, the Washington Island Ferry crew entrusted Insight to create a new brand that reflects their modern operations, but also respects their rich history with the Island community.
