intro: 
  heading: Branding, from start to finish
  copy: '<p>As A to Z Machine, Northeast Wisconsin’s leading machining source, approached their milestone 25th anniversary, they knew it was also time to modernize their brand. A to Z Machine’s goal was to create a brand that truly reflects its hallmark traits of innovation and precision while maintaining its legacy of quality customer service. Insight collaborated with A to Z Machine’s branding committee to refresh the tagline, design a new logo (including a commemorative 25-year logo), develop complete brand standards and shoot on-site photography. </p>

<p>The new brand came to life on updated building signage, a detailed corporate identity package, a high-end print brochure and a custom, responsive website. A to Z Machine’s public-facing identity now matches the forward-thinking culture and innovative services within their facilities! A successful external brand rollout was matched by equal internal enthusiasm. A to Z Machine reported the largest employee apparel order in the company’s history!</p>

testimonial: 
  copy: "The Insight Creative team was amazing to work with! Our company was in a transitional time, and we didn’t know internally how to make ourselves more visible. Their team worked hard on an entire rebrand strategy that really encompassed what A to Z Machine was all about. They were patient with us when we needed more time and were very responsive to all our requests. We look forward to working more with the Insight team to take our company to the next level."
