  ## Building Trust and Traffic for Wisconsin’s First Full-Service MEP 

  Peyton Daul from Hurckman Mechanical Industries (HMI) reached out to us at Insight Creative, Inc., in fall 2023 for a new website. HMI’s old site was outdated and hard to navigate, and its marketing materials didn’t reflect the strength of its growing business. The company was in the midst of making industry moves, like becoming the first full-service mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) company in Northeast Wisconsin. HMI needed its brand to stand out. After finding us through a Google search, Peyton brought us in to help. 

  We started with a discovery session to dig into who HMI is and how they wanted to show up for customers. From there, we worked on a full website overhaul—more than 75 pages in all—focusing on clarity, user experience and search performance. At the same time, we launched a digital media campaign to start driving traffic to the site. This grew into a full search engine marketing (SEM) strategy designed to bring in high-quality clicks. 

  As the relationship evolved, so did the work. We created new digital ads that highlight HMI’s plumbing services and promote their new MEP capabilities. We developed messaging tools for the sales team and redesigned their corporate ID and marketing collateral—from updated sell sheets and HR folders to feature articles and high-visibility press releases. We’re also producing a long-form safety orientation video for new employees and contractors to support their commitment to safety. 

  Since the new website launched, traffic has climbed steadily. A combination of paid search, improved SEO and a much more user-friendly experience brought HMI’s click-through rate to more than double the industry standard. Engagement rates from both paid and organic search are over 64%, showing that users are connecting and exploring. The new website has brought a 512% increase in total keywords for which HMI shows up on Google. Other impressive results include: 

  <ul>
    <li>369% increase in top 10 keywords, resulting in more visibility on page one of Google search results</li>
    <li>2,550% increase in Search Engine Results Page (SERP) features, including AI overviews</li>
    <li>308% Engaged Site Visits surge (sessions that lasted longer than 10 seconds, had a conversion event or more than two screen views)</li>
    <li>590% increase in monthly total users</li>
    <li>1,136% increase in total engaged sessions from all referral sources</li>
  </ul>

  What began as a website project has grown into a full retainer relationship with ongoing digital strategy, content development and branding support—proof that when the work delivers, the partnership keeps growing, too.
