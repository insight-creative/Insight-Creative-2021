  copy: "<p>As the longest standing advertising agency in Green Bay, Insight Creative, Inc. has served clients in a wide variety of industries since President Jim von Hoff opened the agency with his wife, Monica, in 1988.</p>

  <p>What began as an agency of two, has since grown to a full-service team of talented employees each offering specialized skillsets. From the very beginning, Jim’s vision was to bring all services—design, media, writing, photography and more—under one roof. That’s still a defining characteristic of the agency today.</p>"

    copy: We firmly believe that—for communication to be effective and easy to understand—we must provide substance. Too often, marketers rely on over-inflated language and fancy designs to “wow” their audiences. By using Communication with Substance, we commit to meaningful dialogue. Every message Insight creates leads with the significant information audiences need to act. We believe that clear communication leads to effective communication, and effective communication leads to results!
