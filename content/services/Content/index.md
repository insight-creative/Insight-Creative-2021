    description: "<p>Clear communication gets results. No matter how creative something is, if the message gets lost, it’s destined to fail. We’re never creative for the sake of trying to be clever, cute or obscure. Words need to mean something! Information must be valuable and relevant. That’s why our writers research, ask questions and then ask more questions before our hands hit the keyboard.</p>

    <p>Tireless curiosity guides us to know your company, products and people to then develop a voice that uniquely reflects you and a strategy that achieves your goals. Sure, we could rev the creative engines and toss flashy words into art … but at Insight, we lead with clarity to ensure your message is strategic, accurate and consistent. Then the real fun begins. Smart, meaningful creative is born.</p>"
