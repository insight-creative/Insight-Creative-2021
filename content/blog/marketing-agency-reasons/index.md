This may seem obvious: at Insight Creative, Inc., we wholeheartedly believe in the incredible benefits of hiring a marketing agency, including saving time and money, accessing expertise and experience and gaining a fresh perspective. **But what are the specific benefits for you and your business?** In this blog, we go beyond *telling* you the benefits by also *showing* you seven reasons (through case studies and interviews) why hiring a marketing agency is both cost-effective and smart.

First, let’s look at what we do here and why it’s important.

## What exactly does a marketing agency do?

In short, a marketing agency like Insight Creative is a company that specializes in creating and executing marketing strategies for businesses. But Insight Vice President Niki Petit offered another perspective.

“Our agency **helps clients sell more products and services**,” Niki said. “At the end of the day, it’s about working alongside our clients to move their needle and help them grow.”

Marketing services we specifically house under one roof include:
* **Content**. Copywriting, social media and public relations.
* **Media**. Strategy, research and buying.
* **Web**. Design, development and maintenance.
* **Design**. Branding, digital and print.
* **Digital**. Streaming ads, display and social and search engine marketing.
* **Studio**. Photography, videography and drone.

“As a team, we can do anything marketing-related that a client needs,” Niki added.

## Why is marketing important for your business?

Marketing is crucial for businesses to attract and retain customers, increase brand awareness, and drive sales.

**“You can have the best product or service in the world, but if no one knows about it, you won’t be successful,”** said Insight Account Executive Brian Brost.

Niki added that while marketing cannot create a need for your products or services, it can bring people in when the need is already there. “Our job is to find the people who have the needs our clients can fulfill and make sure those people know our client exists,” she said.

## Top reasons to hire a marketing agency

If you’re looking to implement marketing strategies to target your potential customers and grow your business, one way to do that is by hiring a marketing agency. Here are the **top seven reasons to hire a team of experts** for your marketing needs.

### 1. Solves recruitment challenges

Hiring and training an in-house marketing person or team can be expensive and time-consuming.

“With Insight Creative, you get the skillset of 13 people for the cost of having one person on staff,” Niki said. “In today’s **competitive recruitment market**, any business would be hard-pressed to find a marketing person who’s as experienced as the collective years of experience we bring as a team.”

### 2. Creates efficiencies

**Working with an agency saves your company time.** For example, when our designer creates a flier, that person can alert the social media creator for social posting, followed by our web team to get that information online for your business.

### 3. Saves money

Outsourcing to a marketing agency allows you to focus on your core competencies while leaving marketing to the experts. In the long run, outsourcing to a marketing agency can save your business money by avoiding the need to invest in marketing tools, software and training.

### 4. Provides a scapegoat 

It’s common for new business owners to have media reps knocking on the door before the business is even open.

“We tell our clients, ‘**Let us be the bad guy**,’” Niki said. “We say, ‘Tell any sales reps to talk to your agency.’ That way business owners don’t have to disappoint people who might be potential customers in their community.”

Since our agency is media-neutral, we use what’s best for our clients without pigeonholing them or playing favorites. We never feel obligated or pressured to work with a specific media.

“We’ll only use media that will work, and that changes for every client,” Brian said.

### 5. Expertise and experience

Insight Creative is a team of experts who specialize in different areas of marketing, including branding, writing, social media, SEO, web development, design and more. We stay up-to-date with the latest marketing trends and technologies and can adapt quickly to changes in the market.

“**We have been doing this for 35 years**,” Niki said. “We really know what it takes to move the needle. We were buying Pandora and Facebook ads and learning about AI ahead of trends. When those trends hit this market, we’re already educated and ready to rock.”

### 6. Access to advanced tools and technology

Marketing agencies commonly have access to a range of advanced tools and software that businesses may not be able to afford on their own.

“At Insight, we buy software for our media team that allows us to **add value to our clients**,” Niki shared. “We pay for services such as Semrush for SEO and Sprout Social for social media campaigns to give our clients the best on the market.”

### 7. Objective perspective and fresh ideas

Marketing agencies offer an objective perspective on your business's marketing efforts and identify areas for improvement. 

“We take the emotion out of it,” Brian said. “We understand that *you’re* super excited about your business, but we look at it with fresh consumer eyes. And if you’re not doing well, you might let your emotions lead your decisions rather than business logic or creative thinking. That’s what we’re here for.”
