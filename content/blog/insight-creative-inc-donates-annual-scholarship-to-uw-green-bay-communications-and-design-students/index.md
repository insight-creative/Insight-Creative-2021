To mark their 30th anniversary, Insight Creative donated funds to open the “Insight Creative, Inc. Memorial Annual Scholarship in Honor of Monica von Hoff” in memory of their former Vice President and Creative Director Monica von Hoff, who passed away in 2012. The $1,000 scholarship will be available next spring for communications and design students at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay (the place where Insight Creative founders Jim and Monica von Hoff met). The $1,000 scholarship will be available annually.

The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay is a comprehensive public institution offering undergraduate and graduate programs to 7,158 students. The University transforms lives and communities through exceptional and award-winning teaching and research, innovative learning opportunities and a problem-solving approach to education.
