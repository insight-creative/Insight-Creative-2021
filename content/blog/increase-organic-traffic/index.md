It can be disappointing to discover the brand new site you put so much work into isn’t drawing in the amount of traffic you need. After all, you likely spent a good deal of time, money and resources building a quality brand website. Here’s the good news: you can improve your website traffic and we’re here to break down the top SEO tips to help you do just that.

At Insight Creative, we are constantly implementing optimization strategies to help our clients boost their web traffic, and we’re here for you, too! Get the essential information and expert SEO tips you need to optimize your brand website, outrank your competitors and boost your web traffic.

## Defining Organic Traffic

Before we jump in, let’s talk about organic web traffic and its importance for your brand.

Simply put, organic traffic is unpaid traffic. These are the visitors who come to your website from an external link you didn’t pay to place or promote. The two most common sources of organic website traffic are Google search results and link shares on social media.

### Importance of organic web traffic:

The clear benefit of organic traffic is that it’s free—no paying per click here. Organic website traffic also helps to increase your brand awareness and generate quality leads with higher conversion rates.

Instead of targeting every online user within a certain area or demographic, organic traffic is much more defined. These users are already searching for information, services and products within your industry via search engines.

When directed to your site, organic visitors are already interested in what you have to offer and are much more likely to make a purchase. This means you can boost your brand awareness, gain more customers and increase sales—all without paying for an ad!

So, how do you start growing your organic website traffic? You’ll have to optimize your site.

## Use SEO to Boost Your Organic Web Traffic

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing a website for search engines like Google. SEO makes it easier for search engines to quickly scan your website and content to determine its value.

When your website is optimized, Google will see your website as an authority. The higher your SEO score, the higher your site will rank in search results.

### Importance of search result rankings:

Search result rankings play a huge factor in your brand site’s organic traffic.

After all, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/#close" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 30% of internet users</a> click the first link of a Google search results page, according to data from Search Engine Journal. This rate drops to 2.5% for the 10th link, with users rarely (if ever) venturing to the second page of search results.

If your website isn’t properly optimized, it likely won’t appear on the coveted first page of search engines. To do that, you’ll need to implement our SEO tips and improve the optimization of your website.

## Best Tools to Increase Your Web Traffic

There are an almost infinite number of tools designed to help improve SEO and boost website traffic. Every SEO tool out there will have its own unique software and features, but they are extremely similar for the most part.

### What do SEO tools do?

Most SEO, lead generation and website traffic booster tools work by providing data about your site and industry. They allow you to research trending keywords to use in your copy, or see which technical aspects of your site need improvement.

### What are the best SEO tools?

Some of the most popular SEO tools include Ahrefs, Google Search Console and SEMRush. Each of these services can provide helpful data and insights to optimize your site.

In fact, our content team at Insight utilizes SEMRush to track the health of our client sites, conduct keyword research and more. 

But the truth is, none of these tools are going to optimize your website on their own. It will still be up to you to make the necessary SEO improvements on your brand website.

Most business owners don’t have the time or technical expertise to make these changes without an SEO team or agency. So, how can you boost your website traffic without spending hours slogging through overwhelming technical data?

## How to Boost Your Website Traffic

Owning a business comes with a lot of responsibilities, and being a web developer likely isn’t at the top of your list. That’s okay! You don’t necessarily need to know HTML code or be a web design pro to improve your website’s SEO.

Here are the five SEO tips you can utilize to increase your organic web traffic:

### 1. Improve your site’s page loading speed.

If your web page loads too slowly, users will typically navigate away before it ever loads. This phenomenon is known as a “<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en#:~:text=Bounce%20rate%20is%20single%2Dpage,request%20to%20the%20Analytics%20server." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bounce</a>.”

A high bounce rate can drastically affect your site’s search ranking and prevent organic visitors from finding your site. To avoid web pages with high bounce rates, make changes to improve loading speed as much as possible.

Every second counts when it comes to increasing your page loading speed. In fact, a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/page-load-time-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 Google study</a> found that bounce rate increases by 32% when page load time goes from one to three seconds.

A majority of the changes you can make to improve the load speed of your website pages require a bit of coding and technical knowledge. However, there are changes you can make to improve your load speed even if you don’t have a background in web development.

If you’re not a tech wizard, here are some simple ways to improve your page load speed:

- Reduce the size of your website graphics.
- Use <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/lazy-loading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lazyloading</a>.
- Get rid of unnecessary videos, widgets and add-ons.

### 2. Optimize your website’s mobile format.

It’s 2022 and your brand site _has_ to be properly formatted for mobile use. If not, you’re missing out on a huge potential audience. 

According to Oberlo’s most recent study, over <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">58% of the globe’s internet traffic</a> was made via mobile devices. By ignoring mobile optimization, you’re scamming yourself (and your business) by failing to create a site accessible to the majority of online users.

But, what does it actually mean to format your website for mobile use?

In short, mobile optimization ensures your web visitors all get the same experience on your website, whether they visit via a cell phone, computer or tablet. This requires images and page content to automatically reformat to fit a phone screen, along with other format adjustments.

Not sure whether your site is formatted for mobile devices? <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s free mobile-friendly tool</a> will help you discover which pages need to be optimized.

Improving the mobile experience of your website definitely is a more technical SEO tip. If you don’t have the funds to hire a professional web developer, don’t worry just yet. There are various <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/rwd-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile-optimization tools</a> that can help make your web content responsive to any device.

### 3. Structure your web content.

As a business owner with your own brand website, we’re willing to bet you’ve heard of keyword optimization. This is the practice of loading your pages and content with words, phrases and questions commonly searched for online.

While developing a keyword strategy for your website is still important, keywords cannot be your only SEO tactic. Another component of SEO you’ll have to implement is structured content.

Structuring the content on your website builds an intuitive map through your site’s pages and content. It not only helps your web visitors find what they are looking for on your brand site, but it also helps search engines.

Google and other search engines want to provide web users with the most relevant and useful results possible. Sites with a clear content structure provide a better experience for website visitors and consequently rank higher on search results.

Not sure how to structure your content? The <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/topic-clusters-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hootsuite topic cluster model</a> is a trending structure that has proved successful in organizing site content in a way Google understands.

### 4. Create high-value content.

Along with a well-organized site structure, the content on your brand site also has to be valuable to visitors. The more valuable your site content, the more your visitors and online search engines will trust your site as a leading industry resource.

How can you provide high-value content on your business website? By understanding your audience and what content they want to find.

Does your target audience want to learn more about your industry as a whole? Are they simply searching for the products you sell? Are they more likely to want an in-depth blog post covering a topic, or a short and sweet web page?

Do your research and discover the trending topics within your industry that consumers want to know about. Then you can load your website with high-value content your audience is already interested in.

**Common high-value web content examples:**

- Easily sharable infographics
- Articles answering a frequently Googled question
- FAQ pages regarding your brand’s products/services
- Informative, in-depth guides (like the one you’re currently reading!)

### 5. Share your web content on social media.

<a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backlinks</a>—hyperlinks from outside sources linking back to your website—are a vital component of SEO. Backlinks show search engines that your content is so valuable, others are linking to and sharing it online.

Do you _need_ backlinks? Not necessarily, but they’re becoming an increasingly important component of SEO. If you’re in an industry with hard-to-rank-for keywords and well-established brands, you’ll need backlinks to be competitive.

Earning backlinks from quality sources can be challenging and time-consuming. This process requires a lot of personal research, outreach and relationship building, which all takes quite a bit of time (and patience).

Here’s the good news: you can create your own backlinks via social media!

Every time someone shares a link to your website on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok or elsewhere, your brand site earns a backlink. You can earn your brand site backlinks any time you share a link to your site on social media.

Start earning backlinks for your site and boost your brand awareness by sharing links to your high-value content on your brand’s social media accounts. This won’t just boost your website traffic—it will also show your followers that you’re a trusted industry resource.
