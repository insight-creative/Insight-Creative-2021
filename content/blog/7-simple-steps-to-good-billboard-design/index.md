![10 Tips that Ring True Long After Graduating as a Creative](10-Tips-that-Ring-True-Long-After-Graduating-as-a-Creative.jpg)

When you decide to spend your marketing dollars on a billboard make sure it follows these simple guidelines for maximum effectiveness. Creating a poorly designed billboard is like throwing money away. You want your message to be read and then acted upon.

## 5 Second Rule.

We like to assume that drivers have a max viewing time of 5 seconds when driving by a billboard. Sometimes even less than
that. So make sure your message can be digested and read within 5 seconds or less when designing a board.

## Readability.

Make sure your type sizes and fonts are big enough for people to read from a distance. I test this by actually backing up from my computer and seeing if I can read the billboard artwork from 15 - 20 feet away.

## Contrast.

Make sure your billboard has good contrast and doesn’t use colors on top of colors that are hard to read. Also make sure the background color of the billboard stands out from the sky. We don’t want to use sky colored billboards.

## Minimize the Message.

This is not a print ad so don’t put everything you can think of into your billboard. Keep it short and sweet. I would say
no more than 10-12-words if possible.

## One Picture if Possible.

Use big bold readable pictures that make sense. Ideally one picture and the company logo should be all you need. Or just the company logo and a simple message that communicates what you need.

## Ditch the Phone Number.

There is also no need for phone numbers or web sites on billboards anymore. People are not going to stop and write that stuff down. They will just remember the business and Google it once they are stopped. Thats the goal anyway.

## Location, Location, Location.

Be sure to consider the location of your board. If it’s in the city near an intersection people will have a longer time to view it because they will either be stopped or driving at a slower speed. If it’s located on the highway they will be driving much faster and have much less time to view the board. Consider the 5 second rule as mentioned earlier if your on the highway.

The top four billboards are examples that follow the 7 steps. The below two billboards violate some of the steps.
Both have two many pictures to view in 5 seconds. The blue board has a bad background color, sky. They picked type colors that don’t have enough contrast. White and yellow on light blue is not a good choice. Type is also too small on both boards. The Vodka board should have one big picture of the product and one main message like “Leap Vodka, Vodka of the year, try it today!”

So follow these guidelines and your billboard campaign should be a success. Now billboards don’t work for all businesses and you want to make sure the message and the medium makes sense for your business. We can certainly help with that.
