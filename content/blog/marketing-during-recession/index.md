## How does a recession affect businesses?

In the simplest terms, a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-a-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recession</a> happens when there isn’t enough activity in the economy. Too little demand leads to drops in prices, which many businesses have to mitigate through layoffs and internal budget cuts.

It’s not a guarantee that your business will struggle during a recession, however. In fact, many businesses and industries have record-breaking earning quarters during times of economic struggle.

### Business sectors that do well in a recession:

- Grocery stores and fast food chains
- Streaming services and other at-home entertainment
- Hospitals, clinics and pharmaceutical companies
- Large discount retailers and big-box stores
- Software, digital security, IT and tech companies
- Electricians, plumbers, mechanics and other general contractors

On the other hand, not everyone can reap the benefits of an economic downturn.

### Businesses most affected in a recession:

- Independent retailers
- Sit-down restaurants, bars and coffee shops
- Hotels, airlines, theme parks and other travel-related businesses
- B2B businesses

Regardless of industry, all businesses will have to prepare to make strategic marketing moves in a recession. You can begin to do this by understanding and preparing for the changes most likely to occur in an economic downturn.

### Actions consumers tend to take in a recession:

- Cut unnecessary spending.

- Seek out deals for the products they continue to purchase.

### Actions businesses tend to take in a recession:

- Tighten budgets and narrow marketing segments and strategies.
- Cut vendors with the lowest return on investment.
- Stop making or drastically cut back on new investments.

### Your business can still thrive in a recession.

We know—none of that sounds very hopeful for business owners or marketing specialists. But remember this: the success of your business during a recession isn’t up to chance.

Even in the best economic conditions, businesses require strategic goal setting and implementation to be successful. This still holds true during a recession, when it’s possible for brands to not only stay afloat but flourish.

No matter what industry you’re in, a recession is never an automatic loss for business, nor is it an automatic advantage. Even the most affected businesses, like B2B brands, can succeed with the right strategy.

### B2B sales during a recession

B2B businesses will have to go above and beyond in proving the value and worth of their products and services to businesses already struggling to stay afloat.

This means taking steps like narrowing their marketing segment, targeting high-quality leads, adjusting their positioning and messaging accordingly and focusing on value-driven marketing.

**Spoiler alert**: these are the key steps any business should follow to thrive in a recession—not just B2B businesses.

The success of your business will depend on how you <a href="https://www.supplychainquarterly.com/articles/2052-how-to-respond-faster-to-changing-customer-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respond to the changing market and consumer needs</a>. The best way to do that? Invest in your marketing.

## Why you shouldn’t stop marketing in a recession

<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/more-pressure-on-performance-recession-fears-have-advertisers-aiming-for-conservative-budgets-needing-more-hand-holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noferrer">Many businesses will decrease their marketing budgets</a>—or quit their efforts altogether—in the face of a recession. However, in this attempt to mitigate losses, these companies may be doing themselves a great disservice.

After all, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/APJBA-06-2021-0243/full/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research shows</a> that pulling the plug on established marketing efforts during a recession can often do more damage than good.

### Importance of marketing during a recession

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167811605000108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brands that maintain or increase their marketing budget</a> during a recession are the most likely to flourish. That’s in part because consumers need clear communication and value propositions more than ever during a recession. You can’t do that without marketing.

## Benefits of marketing in a recession

Consumers' needs, fears and buying habits change during a recession. To stay competitive, you’ll have to adjust your marketing accordingly … but we know that’s easier said than done.

Believe it or not, there are key benefits to marketing in a recession. When leveraged correctly, these advantages can help to boost your brand, audience and sales.

**Unique advantages to marketing during a recession:**

- Less competitive advertising
- Increased return on investment
- More opportunity for brand awareness growth

### Less competitive advertising

Many businesses will pull back on their marketing efforts, leaving an opening for brands that create effective recession marketing strategies.

### Increased return on investment

With less competition, marketing and advertising will be cheaper and your marketing investment will go much further.

### More opportunity for brand awareness growth

Your brand’s ongoing presence through an uncertain time has the potential to speak volumes. And with less noise in the market, a compelling marketing campaign can help you boost your brand awareness and visibility faster than ever.

## Effective marketing strategies to implement during a recession

<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/companies-that-thrived-during-the-recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Businesses that continue to market in an economic downturn</a> will have the upper hand over competitors, but that doesn’t mean you should spend recklessly. Marketing in a recession can be risky if you don’t conduct proper market research, create a clear plan or develop strategic tactics.

**For the best chance of success when marketing during a recession:**

- Narrow your target market.
- Adjust your messaging.
- Focus on value-based marketing.
- Prepare your recession strategy ahead of time.

### Narrow your target market.

In hard times, it may sound counterintuitive to market to fewer consumers, but this is an effective strategy for many reasons.

By targeting a highly specific ideal customer profile, your messaging can be more personalized and effective. Plus, your advertising dollars will go further by focusing on obtaining quality leads, rather than an excess of low-converting leads.

### Adjust your messaging.

Emotions run high during recessions. Bring comfort to your audience and <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/customer-service/articles/customer-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspire consumer confidence</a> by leading with messages of hope, compassion and a desire to help.

### Focus on value-based marketing.

In a recession, consumers will be far more conscious about their spending and brands will have to prove why their products/services are worth buying.

Focus your marketing efforts on <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/creating-value-for-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighting the value and necessity of your offerings</a> even in an economically trying time.

### Prepare your recession marketing strategy ahead of time.

The number one strategy to thrive in a recession is to be prepared when the time comes. To survive a recession, create a detailed recession marketing plan for the future and dedicate time to bolster your current marketing efforts.
