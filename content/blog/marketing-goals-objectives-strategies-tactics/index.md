![Marketing Goals, Objectives, Strategy and Tactics](marketing-101-goals-objectives-strategy-and-tactics.jpg)

*“We help develop __strategy__!” … Tell me your __objective__? … What are your advertising __goals__? … Here’s a list of __tactics__ you can use.”*

If you’ve ever tried to develop a marketing strategy, you’ve no doubt encountered the common marketing terms above. But do you really know what they mean?

## Defining commonly misused marketing terms 

Why define marketing goals, objectives, strategies and tactics? These terms may seem basic, but they’re thrown around so often, they’ve begun to lose meaning. 

Many business owners and marketers use the terms goals, objectives, strategies and tactics incorrectly—to the detriment of their marketing efforts and business overall. We’re here to ensure you don’t make the same mistake when developing your marketing strategy. 

As a full-service agency, [Insight Creative](https://insightcreative.com/services/) has helped countless clients understand these essential marketing terms. Read on to learn their true definitions before you get started developing your strategy.

## Goals

Marketing goals are the broad statements that cover what your business hopes to achieve with your marketing efforts.

Think of your goals as the final destination or end result of your overall marketing strategy. For example, you may want to get more organic website traffic, make more online sales or introduce new products.

Marketing goals can be short-term or long-term, but each goal should be clearly defined and supported by measurable objectives. To make this process easier, use the SMART goal structure to develop effective marketing goals.

### SMART goal structure

The SMART goal structure ensures you include all the vital details you’ll need to develop effective marketing goals.  

Each letter in the SMART acronym stands for a different characteristic of effective marketing goals. This ensures each of your goals are __specific__, __measurable__, __attainable__, __relevant__ and __timely__.

## Objectives

Objectives are the __quantifiable__ elements of your strategic marketing plan and goals. Rather than describing your end goal like goals, strategies and tactics, objectives are a measuring tool that helps track your progress.

### Marketing objective examples

Your marketing objectives should be directly related to your marketing goals. 

For example, if your goal is to get more online sales, an appropriate objective could be to increase organic website traffic by 15%.

Other examples of effective marketing objectives include:
* Obtain 200 more Facebook subscribers over the next 30 days. 
* Get 300 newsletter subscribers by January 1st. 
* Rank among the top ten results for our target keywords.

## Strategy

A marketing strategy is the major approach or method you’ll take in order to achieve your marketing goals and answer the question: _“how will we accomplish our objectives?”_

Strategies _don’t_ describe specific activities—those are __tactics__. Strategies provide a broad overview of your overall marketing goals, objectives and tactics without getting too detailed.

### Marketing strategy examples

* Business-to-business (B2B) marketing 
* Direct marketing 
* Content marketing
* Social media marketing

## Tactic

Marketing tactics are the actions or specific ways you’ll do things in order to execute your overall marketing strategy and achieve your goals and objectives.

Tactics include the concrete actions you’ll undertake, as well as the physical pieces you’ll create or the connections you’ll make within your marketing strategy.

### Marketing tactic examples
* Write engaging blog posts. 
* Engage with commenters and followers on social media. 
* Provide valuable downloadable [gated content](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free).
