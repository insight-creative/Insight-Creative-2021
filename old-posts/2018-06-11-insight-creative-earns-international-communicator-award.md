“This always felt like a special promotional piece to me—especially after we added the cake scent to it,” said Jay Bauer, creative director with Insight Creative. “I am happy to see the judges at the Communicator Awards agreed.”

The “New Business Cake” was designed specifically to open the door to new potential clients. The direct mail piece used a cardboard cake to emphasize—when it comes to both cake *and* advertising—there’s no cheap easy substitute for the real thing. An actual Insight-branded cake was delivered as a follow-up to a meeting request.
