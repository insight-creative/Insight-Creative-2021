2018 is a big year for Insight Creative, Inc. It’s the year we celebrate 30 years in business and while it hasn’t always been easy, it’s always been fun. Let’s turn the clock back three decades. 

In 1988 a gallon of gas cost 91 cents, a movie ticket was $3.50 and a postage stamp was 24 cents (per thepeoplehistory.com). It was also the year that a husband and wife team from Green Bay, Wisconsin decided to combine their marketing and business knowledge to start an ad agency. With only a few dollars in their pocket, but big ideas in mind, they set forth to create an agency that provided complete marketing communications services under one roof. 

I’m proud to say after many years of hard work, a little stubbornness, and lots of marketing and creative savvy, they succeeded. What is the secret to their success?

1. **Listen more than you speak.** It seems simple but so many people want to talk more than they listen and businesses are no exception. How many times have you walked into an agency to find their trophies and awards boldly on display? At Insight we don’t flaunt and we don’t brag. Instead we listen. We listen to what the client needs and do our best to meet that need with great ideas that will help them achieve their goals.
2. **Always take care of the customer.** You’ve heard the mantra that __*the customer is always right*__. While we live that motto, we’re not afraid to challenge our customers. We challenge them to go farther and dream bigger. We do our best to not only meet their needs, but exceed their expectations. In doing so, our clients have become family and made Insight part of their core team.
3. **Provide a great product at a fair price.** Creative ideas and stellar marketing takes an investment, however we know business expenses can soar and the marketing you launch must offer a return on investment. We don’t take this lightly and we work hard to provide a fantastic product for your investment.

A lot has changed since 1988, but at Insight Creative our commitment to the client remains firm.  We thank you for your business, your support and most importantly your friendships over the years.  We look forward to working with you again this year.  Here’s to a prosperous 2018!
